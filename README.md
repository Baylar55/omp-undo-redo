Official npm package: [@baylarsadigov/omp-undo-redo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@baylarsadigov/omp-undo-redo)

A small extension for session and file undo/redo in Oh My Pi (OMP) and Pi. It adds `/undo` and `/redo` without modifying either agent's source code or session format.

## Agent compatibility

This package supports two related coding agents:

- **Oh My Pi (OMP)** — the fork used by this project. Website: [omp.sh](https://omp.sh). Source repository: [can1357/oh-my-pi](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi).
- **Pi** — the upstream coding agent. Website: [pi.dev](https://pi.dev). Source repository: [badlogic/pi-mono](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono).

The extension uses the shared extension APIs provided by compatible OMP and Pi releases. See the links above for the respective projects and installation documentation.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer.
- A compatible OMP or Pi release.

## Installation

Install the extension through OMP's plugin manager. Running `npm install` in an arbitrary project only downloads the package; it does not register the extension with OMP:

```sh
omp plugin install @baylarsadigov/omp-undo-redo
```

To pin an exact release:

```sh
omp plugin install @baylarsadigov/omp-undo-redo@1.0.16
```

To update an existing installation, run the same command with the new version, or use:

```sh
omp plugin upgrade @baylarsadigov/omp-undo-redo
```

OMP discovers the compiled entry through the package manifest:

```json
{
  "omp": {
    "extensions": ["./dist/index.js"]
  }
}
```

The `pi.extensions` manifest is also included for Pi-compatible loaders. Do not add a second extension entry when the package is installed through the plugin manager.

### Pi

Install the package through Pi's package manager, not with a standalone `npm install`:

```sh
pi install npm:@baylarsadigov/omp-undo-redo
```

To pin a release:

```sh
pi install npm:@baylarsadigov/omp-undo-redo@1.0.16
```

To update installed Pi packages:

```sh
pi update --extensions
```

Use `pi list` to confirm the package is installed, then restart the Pi TUI. The `/undo` and `/redo` commands should appear in slash-command completion.

## Usage

The extension exposes exactly these commands:

- `/undo` — move to the latest user-prompt boundary, removing that prompt's assistant/tool activity from the active context. The prompt itself remains as the supported OMP session-tree boundary. If the current context is already at that boundary, it reports that undo is unavailable.
- `/redo` — restore the most recently undone context checkpoint. Redo is single-use in order: after a new branch or any navigation that is not the matching redo, the in-memory redo history is cleared.

Commands take no arguments. They navigate OMP's session tree through the official extension API and do not create a new model turn.
Both commands wait for the current agent turn to become idle; if OMP remains busy, the command leaves the session unchanged and shows a warning.

## Limitations

Undo/redo creates private Git snapshot objects through an alternate index and `git commit-tree`, then retains them with refs under `refs/omp-undo-redo/`. Checkpoint creation never moves `HEAD` or any branch ref. `/undo` and `/redo` apply file deltas only; they do not undo commits or branch switches. The real Git index is preserved, and releasing a checkpoint removes its private refs. A checkpoint covers the complete Git worktree that contains the session cwd; starting OMP from a repository subdirectory does not limit undo/redo to that subtree. Dirty files that existed before the turn are included in both snapshots and remain unchanged by undo/redo. Changes made anywhere in the repository during the turn can be part of the checkpoint because Git snapshots cannot determine authorship; this is an architectural limitation. The supported guarantee is: restores the non-ignored file changes represented by the checkpoint while preserving Git branch history and the real index. Ignored files, empty directories, dirty submodule contents, shell effects, network effects, and editor state are outside the checkpoint. Clean/smudge filters, `core.autocrlf`, submodules, and ignored files prevent a universal byte-for-byte guarantee. If overlapping worktree changes prevent safe application, undo/redo fails instead of overwriting them. A forced process termination may leave stale private refs; inspect them with `git for-each-ref refs/omp-undo-redo/` and remove only confirmed stale refs.

## Development

Install dependencies with npm, then use the scripts in `package.json`:

- `npm run build` compiles `src/` to `dist/`.
- `npm run typecheck` checks TypeScript without emitting files.
- `npm test` runs the deterministic test suite.
- `npm run lint` and `npm run format:check` check style.
- `npm run verify` runs the repository verification sequence.

The implementation uses only public OMP extension APIs. Keep changes focused, preserve the package manifest, and do not commit generated `dist/` output unless a release process explicitly requires it.

## Release

A release consists of a reviewed change, a clean verification run, an updated `CHANGELOG.md` entry, and a published npm package containing `index.js`, `dist/`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `CHANGELOG.md`. The package manifest is the source of truth for the extension entry point and peer compatibility. Never place npm tokens, registry credentials, or other secrets in the repository or release logs.
